This project is a pen pal back and forth that includes decoding messages with a specific offset and sending encoded messages back. In this project, we have created functions that can decode these messages, create our own encoded messages with whatever offset that we want. This project is from the Codecademy Data Science: Machine Specialist Career Path course.
